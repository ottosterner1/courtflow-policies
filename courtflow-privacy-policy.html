        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 26, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to CourtFlow. This Privacy Policy explains how CourtFlow ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects personal information when tennis clubs and coaches use our coaching management platform.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> CourtFlow provides software tools to tennis clubs and coaches. The clubs and coaches who use our platform are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate consent from parents/guardians before entering any personal data into our system. Each club is the data controller for their members' data.
        </div>

        <h2>2. Our Role as Data Processor</h2>
        <p>CourtFlow acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> on behalf of tennis clubs and coaches (the <strong>data controllers</strong>). This means:</p>

        </ul>

            <strong>Children's Data:</strong> CourtFlow may process personal data about children under 16 (including under 13).
